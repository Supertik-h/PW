            Hi! My name is Julia, I’m 18 years old, and my biggest passion is computer science — especially game development, where I can combine creativity with technology. I love challenges, and creating games allows me to bring together logical thinking and coding with designing engaging worlds and characters that inspire and captivate others. I’ve been fascinated by computers and the digital world since I was little, but it was video games that truly captured my imagination.

          <p> When working on projects, I always strive to achieve the best possible results by learning new programming languages, tools, and technologies. I find great satisfaction in solving problems, optimizing code, and building projects that others can enjoy. One of my biggest strengths is perseverance — if something needs improvement, I’m always ready to spend extra time refining the details so the final outcome reflects my skills and meets my standards. </p>
          Outside of programming, I love spending time on the volleyball court. Sports help me take a break from the screen, while also teaching teamwork, quick decision-making, and working toward a common goal. I try to carry these same values into my tech projects — whether I’m working in a team or collaborating with other passionate creators.

          By balancing sports with computer science, I’ve found a way to stay both physically active and intellectually challenged. On my GitHub, you’ll find the projects I’ve worked on and the ideas I’m developing — each one is a step in my journey to becoming a better game developer and programmer. I share code, solutions, and documentation that reflect my workflow and problem-solving mindset. I hope you find something inspiring there and get a glimpse of how much joy programming brings me — and how I see the future of technology, especially in the world of games.
